WebGL Source Engine Renderer
=======================

WebGL app that renders levels from the Source Engine, created against Team Fortress 2 resources. 
The Source Engine and anything related to it is the property of Valve Software, who does not 
authorize or endorse this project in any way.

A note about game resources
---------------------------

I do not have rights to redistribute any Valve resources, and as such this repository does not 
contain any. To run the demo you will need to extract the files from the GCF files from your own 
copy of Team Fortress 2. You can see some details on the extraction process 
[here](http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GCFScape). Also, you will need to convert all VTF
files (textures) to PNGs. [VTFEdit](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?c=178#p178) can
do the conversion as a batch.
